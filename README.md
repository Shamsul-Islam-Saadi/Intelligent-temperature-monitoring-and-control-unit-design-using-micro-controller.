# Intelligent-temperature-monitoring-and-control-unit-design-using-micro-controller.

Project description:
This project aims to design an intelligent temperature monitoring and control unit using an Arduino micro-controller board. It will be able to measure the current temperature, compare it with a reference temperature value and take appropriate actions by providing appropriate output signals as input to heater/cooler. The unit will have a easy to read LCD screen for showing the status. The reference temperature value will be real-time adjustable using a control knob.
